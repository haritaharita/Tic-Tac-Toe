# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this game, we prints out a 3x3 board filled with dashes, signifying empty spots. Each turn it asks either player 1 or player 2 to enter a row and col index which is where they want to place their x and o, and then the board is printed again with the x or o in the right spot. Once the player wins by getting 3 in a row, column, or diagonal, the program prints that player 1 or 2 has won and prints out the final board. This project made by two team members.
